// Step 3
// Now that the ReferenceError is resolved, the console is displaying the correct results for a random number between 0 and 9. But CamperBot was not expecting to see decimal numbers like these:

// Example Code
// 0.015882899879771095
// 2.114596286197641
// 6.040964780197666
// Update the console statement to print a whole number between 0 and 9.

// Remember that you worked with a method in the Role Playing Game that rounds a number down to the nearest whole number.
