// Step 2
// Now, CamperBot is trying to create a function that will return a random index from the darkColorsArr. But they have run into the following error message:
// Example Code
// Uncaught ReferenceError: math is not defined
// A ReferenceError is thrown when a non-existent variable is referenced. In this case, it looks like CamperBot is trying to use math but JavaScript doesn't have a math object.
// Fix CamperBot's error in the math.random() line and open up the console again.
