// Step 1
// CamperBot is trying to build out a random background color changer. But they keep running into issues and need your help to debug the code.
// CamperBot has already added the HTML and CSS for the project. But they are confused as to why none of the styles and content is showing up on the page.
// When they open up the console they see this message:
// Example Code
// SyntaxError: unknown: Unexpected token, expected "," (5:2)
// Syntax errors are thrown when the JavaScript engine encounters something it can't interpret. In this case, it looks like CamperBot has syntax errors in the darkColorsArr array.
// Fix the syntax errors in the darkColorsArr array and you should see the content and styles show up on the page.
const darkColorsArr = [
    "#2C3E50",
