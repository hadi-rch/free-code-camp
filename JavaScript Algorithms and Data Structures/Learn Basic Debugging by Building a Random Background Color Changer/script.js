// Step 4
// CamperBot is finished with building out the getRandomIndex function and it is working as expected.

// But now they are running into this issue when trying to create a reference to the body element in the DOM:

// Example Code
// Uncaught TypeError: document.queryselector is not a function
// A TypeError means that the code is trying to perform an operation on a value that is not of the expected type.

// Fix the TypeError by updating the document.queryselector method to the correct method name that selects an element from the DOM.
const body = document.querySelector("body");
