//   Step 5
//   CamperBot has created a new variable called bgHexCodeSpanElement to store the reference to the span element with the id of bg-hex-code. However, when they try to log that variable to the console, they get null.
//   null is a special value in JavaScript that represents the absence of a value. This can happen when you try to access a property of an object that doesn't exist.
//   In this case, CamperBot is not passing in the correct selector to the document.querySelector method.
//   Fix the document.querySelector("bg-hex-code") line so that it correctly selects the element with the id of bg-hex-code.

  const bgHexCodeSpanElement = document.querySelector("#bg-hex-code");
