    <!-- Step 3 One of the most powerful tools is your developer console. Depending
    on your browser, this might be opened by pressing F12 or Ctrl+Shift+I. On
    Mac, you can press Option + âŒ˜ + C and select "Console". You can also click
    the "Console" button above the preview window to see our built-in console.
    The developer console will include errors that are produced by your code,
    but you can also use it to see values of variables in your code, which is
    helpful for debugging. Add a console.log("Hello World"); line between your
    script tags. Then click the "Console" button to open the console. You should
    see the text "Hello World". -->
    <script>
      console.log("Hello World");
    </script>
