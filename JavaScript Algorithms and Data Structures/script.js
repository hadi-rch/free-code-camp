// Step 10
// Declare two more variables named monsterHealth and inventory.
// For your inventory variable, assign it the value of an array containing the string "stick".

// Example Code
// let exampleArray = ["first", "second", "third"];
let xp = 0;
let health= 100;
let gold= 50;
let currentWeaponIndex = 0;
